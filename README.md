# django-gbucket

A base project incorporating gcloud buckets with django. This is meant to be a starting point for other projects that I have using gcloud buckets with django. There is adequate docuemntation, but there were
enough gotchas that I thought a working repo would be useful for my future self as well as others.

Obviously, there is limited utility in production for the repo as-is. Use and modify at your own risk.

# Raodmap
* Initial Release: import gcloud storages and setup for a bucket as the storage backend.
* Milestone: example route for uploading files stored to bucket.
* Milestone: example route for extracting file from bucket

... and that's it! After these are done, I will try to update for future versions of the google cloud storages package and django.
